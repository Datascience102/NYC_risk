# NYC_risk

We tried to analyze and identify patterns regarding car accidents in New York City ("NYC"). In order to acheive this objective we have obtained from the New York Police Department ("NYPD") open source data with almost two years of accidents.

Discalimer: Please note that in order to run this project on a local computer, you will have do download the files in the GITHUB repository and extract the CSV file from the NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_2.csv.zip

Please name the file: data/NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_Official.CSV

Thank you!
